<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Christina,
   and I'm 25 years old. I currently live in Pasay City, Philippines, 
   where I work as a Risk Management and Compliance Officer.</p>

<p>I started this website as a way to share my knowledge and experiences with others. Over the years, 
  I've developed a passion for web developing, 
  and I'm excited to use this platform to explore those interests further.</p>

<p>In my free time, you can usually find me playing online games. 
  I also love watching movies, and I'm always on the lookout for new things to learn and explore.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as 
  I've enjoyed creating it. If you have any questions or comments, 
  please don't hesitate to get in touch with me!</p>
